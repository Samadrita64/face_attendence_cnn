Face recognition using CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) is a popular method for automated attendance systems. CNNs are particularly well-suited for image-based tasks like face recognition due to their ability to learn hierarchical features from images. An automated attendance system using CNNs typically involves detecting faces, extracting features, and then comparing those features against a database of known individuals to mark attendance. 
Here's a more detailed explanation:
1. Face Detection: 
The system first needs to identify faces within an image or video frame. This is often done using pre-trained face detection models like Haar cascades or more advanced methods like MTCNN (Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks).
These models identify the location of faces, often with bounding boxes, allowing the system to isolate the face region for further processing.
